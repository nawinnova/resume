- project: PhD Research - Investigating the Slow Solar Wind Origin from Coronal Hole Boundaries
  # role: Founder & Primary Developer
  duration: 2021 &mdash; Present
  description: >- 
    The origin of slow solar wind remains an open question in solar physics. The objective of this research 
    is to contribute to the problem by trying to understand what mechanisms drive the formation of slow
    solar wind at coronal hole boundaries (CHBs). The small-scale evolution of CHBs over short-time
    periods is primarily driven by interchange reconnection, which is also thought to be one mechanism
    responsible for slow solar wind formation. Connecting the results from high-resolution remote-sensing
    observations of the solar atmosphere with in-situ measurements in interplanetary space will provide
    new insights that will help answer the open question.

- project: Analysis of Turbulence Energy Transfer at an Interplanetary Shock Observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission
  # role: Co-Founder & Organizer
  duration: 2021 &mdash; Present

  description: >- 
    In this work, we examine burst-mode observations by the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS)
    for an interplanetary shock passage on 8 January 2018. We use a Kolmogorov-Yaglom Law for the
    third-order structure function and a von Karman-decay law to calculate the energy dissipation rates
    at the inertial scale and energy-containing scale, respectively. The results show that the downstream
    region of the shock has stronger and better developed turbulence and a higher energy transfer rate than
    the upstream region.

- project: Undergraduate Senior Project - Domains of Magnetic Pressure Balance in Parker Solar Probe Observations of the Solar Wind
  # role: Co-Founder & Organizer
  duration: 2020 &mdash; 2021

  description: >- 
    This research investigated the domains of nearly constant magnetic field magnitude as observed from
    the Parker Solar Probe (PSP). The study used data from the first five solar encounters of PSP and
    analyzed these domains in various aspects, such as statistical distribution, relation with plasma beta
    and aspect ratio of domains. The results showed that an inverse association between the mean domain
    duration and plasma Î² and the domain duration relates to the waiting time between events that disrupt
    the near constancy of |B|, many of which are switchbacks.
